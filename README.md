## 1.1 Problem Statement
Freddie Mac is a public government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and was chartered by Congress in
1970 to keep money flowing to mortgage lenders in support of homeownership and rental housing.
Their mission is to provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the U.S. housing market. Freddie
Mac is making the loan datasets openly accessible as part of an effort to increase transparency and
help investors build more accurate credit performance models in support of ongoing and future credit
risk-sharing transactions.   

With this project, we aim to build several benchmarking high-accuracy predictive models that can
evaluate the risks of issued single-family mortgage loans and select the best performer to deploy into a
user-friendly reactable application. We plan to approach the problem by first defining risky events
based on one or a combination of financial features provided in the dataset by data exploration and
feature engineering. Basically taking all the given features as inputs and defining as well as
engineering a target output that represents the higher risk events that lead to bad loan performance.
Second step is to explore the best algorithm to predict the target with input features, let it be
classification models that identify the probability of the risk event, or regression models to quantify
the target risk score by finding the coefficient relationship between target and input features. We also
plan to perform clustering to group the provided loans into similar risk levels to assist the model
building process. Eventually, if time and funding permits, we hope to create and deploy an interactive
application that utilizes the best performing algorithm.   

## 1.2 Project Relevance
Since the dataset provides extensive details that track the financials of the mortgage loans at their
origination and their monthly performance after being issued, it can be used for generating business
insights for various types of investors or entities such as homebuyers, appraisers, brokers, lenders and
non-profits. It is challenging and interesting to form a data science project where we can explore ways
to speed up the data processing time, and form insightful data analysis on the loan performance while
developing robust machine learning risk prediction model
